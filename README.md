# GI
ABEAM AMO BI Platform - JS and Python programs

# Background
We are aiming to create one open-source BI platform, which is based on the airbnb's superset. 
Before integrating all new-added or revised programs into one project, we plan to take this 
repo as intermediate steps to share and verify coding, then move to the coming platform.

# What to be included:
1) Javascripts for new chart types.
2) Python scripts to modify and extend the supersets.
